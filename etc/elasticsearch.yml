# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please see the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------

# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:

cluster.name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}

# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------

# Assign the container ID to the node name so to eliminate having to translate
# between the two while debugging.

node.name: es-${HOSTNAME}

# By default, all nodes are eligible to become masters and store data.

node.master: ${ES_NODE_MASTER}
node.data: ${ES_NODE_DATA}

# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
# node.rack: r1

# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------

# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):

path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch/data

# Path to log files:

path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
# bootstrap.mlockall: true
#
# Make sure that the `ES_HEAP_SIZE` environment variable is set to about half the memory
# available on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------

# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):

network.host: _eth0:ipv4_

# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
# http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, see the documentation at:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html>
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
# gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, see the documentation at:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-gateway.html>
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Elasticsearch nodes will find each other via unicast, by default.
# For more information, see the documentation at:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery.html>
#
# Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of nodes / 2 + 1):
#
# discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3

# We'll bootstrap cluster communications by getting a master node via
# the ContainerPilot `preStart` directive, which will rewrite this
# configuration value with the appropriate hostname.

discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["${ES_BOOTSTRAP_HOST}"]

# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Disable starting multiple nodes on a single system:
#
# node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
# action.destructive_requires_name: true
